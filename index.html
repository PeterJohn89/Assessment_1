                                            Our target audience is children from ages 5 to 7. The design of our website
                                            is important too, Children at that ages have short attention spans, So our
                                            site must have bold font, bright colours, engaging and interactive.

                                            There are a number of tools and Technologies in order to develop any mobile
                                            applications, Java can be used with eclipse software, Python and Javascript
                                            can be used on Sublime Text, and for IOS systems a programming language
                                            called Swift. Just as Java code is uses with Eclipse software, Swift is
                                            used with Xcode. Xcode is a IDE ( integrated development environment) for
                                            macOS. It is free software to help build app user interface, Xcode also
                                            supports programming languages such as Objective C.

                                            When It comes to web development, one of the most powerful languages today
                                            that has stood the test of time is Javascript. Javascript is incredibly
                                            versatile, with the ability to create interactive games, 3D animation.
                                            Javascript is very flexible easy to learn and has a huge amount of
                                            libraries, and technical support. There are many resources available for
                                            web and mobile programming.
